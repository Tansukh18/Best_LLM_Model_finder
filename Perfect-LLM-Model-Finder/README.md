## What is Perfect LLM Model Finder? 🤔

Perfect LLM Model Finder is a tool designed to simplify the overwhelming process of choosing the right LLM. With so many options out there, making the right choice can feel daunting. I've taken the heavy lifting off your shoulders by integrating Open LLM Benchmarks to analyze and rank models based on their performance for your specific requirements.

It helps you find your perfect open-source LLM match in 2 Simple Steps!
You won't have to use the same model for every task. Use the best open-source model backed by Open LLM Benchmarks for your task! 

Features:
1. **Global Language Support**: Compatible with 100+ languages for worldwide accessibility
2. **Comprehensive Benchmarking**: Leverages 6 different LLM benchmarks for accurate matching
3. **Real-time Updates**: Benchmark data refreshes every 2 hours for up-to-date recommendations
4. **Quality Assured**: Only suggests official, non-flagged models you can trust

Just describe your task and set your size preference - it'll handle the rest!

## Features 🎯

- **Interactive Interface:** Powered by Streamlit, the app makes it super easy and intuitive to use.
